* **Beats:** Mitchell and Walsh observe spring break firsthand—parking lot parties, students drinking openly, hotel-hopping between properties. Hundreds of young people, transient, nobody tracking movements. Interview college students: feel safe in groups and locked rooms, don't notice maintenance workers ("just background"). Walsh sees vulnerability: intoxication, unfamiliar environment, false security. Surveillance on Weber from distance—working on pool equipment at Badger Inn, observing spring breakers, taking notes on clipboard (appears maintenance-related).

* **Beats:** Mitchell conducts off-record staff interviews revealing motel row reality: unreported sexual assaults, drug dealing, seasonal worker exploitation, minimal oversight. Spring break brings worst behavior—property damage, violence, overdoses handled quietly to protect business. Owners cut corners on security and staffing for profit margins. Underpaid employees, high turnover except long-term workers like Weber. Housekeeping staff describe finding drug paraphernalia, blood, violence evidence—clean it up, never report.

Master keys to everything—rooms, offices, storage, maintenance areas. Schedule flexibility, complete trust from owners. Employment records: twenty years, never complained about, raises and bonuses. No family, no social life, church attendance. Lives rental house near Route 12. Mitchell requests surveillance authorization—watch Weber's movements.

* **Beats:** Weber surveillance day two: routine maintenance work across properties, lunch alone, evening fundamentalist church service, home. Nothing suspicious observed. Meanwhile Mitchell investigates second victim's boyfriend—aggressive during initial interview, jealous personality, had opportunity. Diverts investigation resources checking alibi. Walsh skeptical but supports thoroughness. Boyfriend's alibi confirmed: witnessed at party forty miles away during murder window, multiple corroborations. Mitchell frustrated—seemed promising lead. Walsh reminds: elimination process necessary in investigation. Letter forensic analysis returns: typewriter common brand (hundreds locally), paper generic, handwriting expert confirms genuine emotional state. No fingerprints, dead end. Return focus to Weber: surveillance shows watching spring breakers, clipboard notes (ambiguous—maintenance or victim selection?).

* **Dialogue Topics:** Mitchell questioning boyfriend aggressively. Walsh expressing skepticism about lead. Forensic analyst delivering disappointing results via phone. Mitchell and Walsh debating surveillance observations.

* **Emotional Arc:** Mitchell's frustration at false lead balanced by professional resilience. Walsh's patient methodology validated. Partnership strengthening through disagreement.

POV: Sarah Mitchell, third person limited
Setting: New Covenant Church, Sheriff's office
Time: Evening into Sunday

* **Purpose:** Deep psychological analysis of letters, identify Weber's church and theology, establish genuine delusion profile.

* **Beats:** Mitchell analyzes letter content deeply: Leviticus, Romans, Revelation quotations—fire-and-brimstone judgment theology. References specific fundamentalist tradition: sin as corruption requiring purification, youth culture as Sodom. Cross-reference local churches: identifies three fundamentalist congregations. Weber attends New Covenant Church—strict theology, moral condemnation of secular culture. Mitchell attends Sunday service undercover: pastor's sermon about moral decay, spring break as societal corruption example. Congregation agreement. Weber present, taking notes. After service, Weber speaks with pastor about "witnessing sin" and being "instruments of judgment." Mitchell shaken—genuinely believes divine mission.
