# Scriptwriter Onboarding: American Casefile

## Your Mission

Write 30 chapters of 1,700 words each, following the detailed chapter outlines to produce a complete 51,000-word procedural mystery novel. You expand scene-level guidance into full prose through dialogue, description, and internalization.

**What You Receive:**
- **BIBLE:** Complete reference (characters, setting, mystery structure, tone). Load once, reference constantly.
- **MASTER OUTLINE:** Complete story arc (30 chapters at-a-glance). Load once, check for continuity.
- **DETAILED CHAPTER OUTLINE:** Beat-by-beat scene guidance (one chapter at a time). This is your direct instruction.

**What You Create:** 1,700-word chapter following outline structure. The outline gives you scene beats, dialogue direction, and investigation progress. You provide full dialogue, sensory detail, character internalization, and atmospheric texture.

Reference master-context.md for project specifications. Reference Bible for character/setting consistency. Don't repeat information from these documents.

## Core Principle: Expand, Don't Invent

**Trust the outline.** It contains all plot beats, clues, character moments, and investigation progress. Your job is expansion through execution:

**Outline says:** "Martinez questions suspect about alibi. Suspect defensive, story changes. Thompson notices inconsistency."

**You write (example):**
- Full dialogue exchange (4-6 dialogue beats, natural conversation rhythm)
- Martinez's questioning technique and body language
- Suspect's defensive reactions, evasions, tells
- Thompson's quiet observation and note-taking
- Room atmosphere, tension building
- Martinez's internal assessment of credibility
- Thompson's specific observation of the inconsistency
- How the exchange shifts investigation

**Expansion Techniques:**

**Dialogue** (outline gives topics/tone):
- Write natural conversations, 2-6 line exchanges
- Character voices should be distinct (reference Bible)
- Period-appropriate speech patterns
- Subtext and evasion in witness interviews
- Professional shorthand between investigators
- Regional dialect markers (subtle, not caricature)

**Sensory Description** (outline sets scene):
- Visual: specific details, not generic
- Sound: ambient atmosphere and specific noises
- Smell: environmental markers
- Touch/physical sensation: weather, textures
- Taste: when relevant (coffee, diner food, salt air)

**Internal Thoughts** (outline gives emotional state):
- POV investigator's assessments and reactions
- Professional analysis of evidence/suspects
- Observations about partner or case dynamics
- Period-specific thinking (no modern forensic assumptions)
- Brief, integrated with action (not long introspective passages)

**Atmospheric Details** (outline indicates mood):
- Weather as texture
- Setting-specific environmental markers
- Time-of-day quality
- Seasonal indicators
- Regional character

**Pacing and Rhythm** (outline gives beats):
- Scene openings establish quickly
- Dialogue scenes move naturally (beats of conversation)
- Investigation scenes balance detail and momentum
- Transition between scenes with brief spatial/temporal markers
- Chapter endings create forward pull

## Professional Procedural Mystery Style

**Documentary Texture:**
- Clean, direct prose - accessible not literary
- Show investigation process methodically
- Trust reader to follow without over-explanation
- Specific over generic (actual lab processes, not "forensics")
- Observational stance, not interpretive

**What This Looks Like:**

Good: "Thompson photographed the tire tracks while Martinez sketched the scene layout on grid paper. The ground was soft enough to show tread detail. Forensics would need plaster casts, but that meant a six-hour drive to the state lab and back."

Avoid: "The detectives meticulously documented everything, knowing these small details could crack the case wide open. Every piece of evidence mattered in the complex dance of criminal investigation."

**Investigation Authenticity:**
- Show actual investigative work (not just "investigated")
- Witness interviews with evasions and contradictions
- Evidence collection procedures
- Interdepartmental coordination and friction
- Resource limitations and workarounds
- Waiting for lab results, dealing with bureaucracy
- Geographic legwork (driving between locations)

**Mystery Structure:**
- Clue placement matches outline (don't reveal early or hide)
- Red herrings feel plausible when introduced
- Fair play: reader has same information as investigators
- Let readers try to solve alongside investigators
- No investigator withholding from reader
- Resolution through police work, not luck

**Tone Balance:**
- Serious but not grim
- Atmospheric but not melodramatic
- Professional but with personality
- Tension with breathing room
- Restrained emotion (these are professionals)

## 1970s-1980s Period Authenticity

**Technology & Communication:**
- Rotary phones, payphones (need quarters)
- No answering machines in most places
- Paper files, typewriters, carbon copies
- Physical photo development (waiting days)
- Face-to-face or phone coordination (no texts, no email)
- Maps and asking directions
- Radio communication for official channels

**Investigation Methods:**
- No DNA databases, no digital records
- Fingerprint cards physically compared
- Criminal records through teletype or phone
- Lab results take days/weeks
- Physical surveillance and legwork
- Handwritten notes and reports
- Evidence logs on paper

**Period Integration:**
Natural weaving, not info-dumping:

Good: "Martinez used the payphone outside the diner, feeding quarters while waiting on hold for the state police database check."

Avoid: "Because it was 1978 and they didn't have cell phones, Martinez had to use a payphone, which required coins and was less convenient than modern technology."

**Cultural Markers:**
- Vehicle references (specific makes/models)
- Music on radio (specific songs/artists when relevant)
- Brand names period-appropriate
- Social attitudes and norms of era
- Regional culture specific to location
- Seasonal/tourist patterns
- Local industry and economy

## Character Work

**Investigator Partnership:**
Reference Bible for personality traits and dynamics. Show partnership through:

**Professional Interaction:**
- Different investigative approaches creating natural friction
- Complementary skills and blind spots
- Respectful disagreement and compromise
- Shared observations and analysis
- Division of labor

**Personal Moments:**
- Brief conversations during travel or waiting
- Observations about each other's methods
- Dry humor and personality quirks
- Mutual respect even when disagreeing
- Light flirtation (sophisticated, not clumsy)

**NO romance subplot.** These are professionals working a case. Chemistry yes, relationship development no.

**Gender Dynamics:**
Sophisticated and period-aware but not modern:
- Both investigators are competent equals
- He can be masculine (decisive, protective, direct) without being domineering
- She can be feminine (intuitive, detail-oriented, warm) without being weak
- Period-accurate: occasional gender assumptions from others (suspects, local police) - investigators handle professionally
- No modern gender politics - they're partners doing a job

**Supporting Characters:**
- Distinct voices and personalities (reference Bible)
- Serve clear function (witness, informant, obstacle, local color)
- Regional authenticity
- Brief but memorable
- Not caricatures

**The Killer:**
When revealed:
- Grounded psychology (not theatrical)
- Job enabling crimes feels logical
- Caught through investigation, not monologue
- No "explaining evil" - show facts, let reader understand
- Understated resolution

## Setting & Atmosphere

Reference Bible for setting details. Make location a character through:

**Sensory Specificity:**
- Regional weather patterns
- Seasonal markers (spring mud, summer heat, fall colors)
- Geographic features (mountains, water, forests, towns)
- Local industry (fishing, logging, tourism, agriculture)
- Community gathering spots (diner, bar, general store)
- Investigator accommodations (motel, inn)

**Regional Character:**
- How locals talk and interact
- Economic situation and social structure
- Tourist vs. local tension (if applicable)
- Isolation factors
- Community attitudes toward outsiders
- Pride and defensiveness about their town

**Investigation Challenges from Setting:**
- Geographic distances and travel time
- Weather affecting work
- Remote locations and access issues
- Limited resources in small jurisdictions
- Communication difficulties
- Community resistance or cooperation

## Chapter Structure & Pacing

**Strong Openings:**
- Ground reader immediately (where, when, who)
- Set atmosphere quickly
- Launch into scene action (not setup)
- Carry momentum from previous chapter when appropriate

**Building Through Scenes:**
- 2-4 scenes per chapter typically
- Clear transitions between scenes
- Each scene has purpose (investigation, relationship, atmosphere)
- Balance investigation intensity with breathing room
- Period/location details woven naturally throughout

**Impactful Endings:**
- Forward momentum or revelation
- Tension or question
- Discovery or complication
- Not always cliffhanger - sometimes quiet anticipation
- Should make reader want to continue

**Scene Balance Pattern:**
Investigation Scene → Relationship/Atmospheric Scene → Investigation Scene (varies by chapter needs)
