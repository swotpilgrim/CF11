# Master Context: American Casefile

## Project Overview

American Casefile is a 12-book standalone mystery series combining cosy mystery sensibilities with professional law enforcement procedural investigation. Set in 1970s-1980s America, each novel features a distinctive regional location, a unique serial killer with memorable MO, and two archetypal law enforcement investigators. The format delivers "one town, one case, one investigation" - reliable structure with endless geographic and criminal variation targeting cosy mystery readers, true crime enthusiasts, and fans of Louise Penny, Ann Cleeves, and Tony Hillerman.

Each book is completely standalone with no series continuity. Different investigators, locations, and cases every time.

## Mystery-Specific Elements

**Case Scale:** 2-4 victims over weeks to months (serious but contained, not overwhelming)

**MO Development Method - "Heavy Hitter Compound":**
Each killer's MO combines DNA from 2-3 famous real serial killers:
- Source cases: BTK, Zodiac, Bundy, Night Stalker, Green River, Gacy, Wuornos, Kemper, Dahmer, Son of Sam
- Process: Select 2-3 cases → extract signature elements → relocate to chosen setting → remix specific details → amplify creepy/mysterious aspects → add ritualistic/symbolic components → create investigation hooks
- Result: Feels researched and authentic (proven psychological framework) but totally original (untraceable to single source)

**Victim Types:** Must justify why case didn't become media circus
- Transient population (drifters, hitchhikers, seasonal workers)
- Marginalized groups (sex workers, runaways)
- Isolated individuals (elderly, loners)
- Vulnerable within community

**Killer Profile:**
- Job or position enabling crimes (access, trust, mobility)
- Local or regular presence
- NOT theatrical or "evil genius"
- Caught through solid police work
- Plausible psychology for era

**Isolation Mechanisms** (use 2-3 per book to keep case small/cosy):
- Geographic: Remote location, weather isolation, distance from resources
- Jurisdictional: Cross-county complications, federal land, requesting agency wants quiet
- Social: Marginal victims, community resists attention, local politics
- Temporal: Bodies found late, pattern emerges slowly, communication lag
- Practical: Underfunded departments, not spectacular enough yet, other cases pulling resources

**Fair Play Clue Distribution:**
- Early clues reader can't interpret yet
- Red herrings that seem significant
- Overlooked details that matter later
- Witness contradictions to sort through
- Physical evidence building case
- Timeline discrepancies to resolve
- Geographic clues (distances, access, local knowledge)

**Investigation Variety** (rotate throughout):
- Evidence-Based: Crime scenes, forensics, timeline reconstruction, physical evidence
- People-Based: Witness interviews, suspect interrogations, background checks, community informants
- Logic-Based: Pattern recognition, geographic profiling, motive analysis, opportunity assessment
- Procedural: Interdepartmental coordination, warrants, evidence chain, lab results

## Setting Requirements

**Time Period:** 1970s-1980s America

**Period Benefits:**
- Pre-digital investigation (no cell phones, DNA databases, internet)
- Slower communication creates natural pacing
- Physical evidence and legwork required
- Plausible isolation and containment
- Retro nostalgia appeal

**Essential Period Details:**
- Rotary phones and payphones
- Paper files, typewriters, carbon copies
- Waiting days/weeks for lab results
- Physical surveillance and legwork
- Period vehicles, music, culture
- Pre-forensics TV era (no CSI effect)

**Geographic Regions** (cosy mystery optimal):
- Pacific Northwest: Washington, Oregon (misty, forested, coastal)
- Northern California: Coastal, mountain, wine country
- Upper Midwest: Wisconsin, Michigan (lakes, small towns, seasonal)
- Northeast: Massachusetts, Maine (coastal, colonial, autumn beauty)

**Location Requirements per Book:**
- Contained geographic area (cosy mystery requirement)
- Clear community boundaries
- Strong regional identity and atmosphere
- Investigation challenges specific to place
- "Picture postcard" visual appeal
- Seasonal specificity (spring, summer, fall - not winter)

## Character Archetypes

**The Investigators** (different every book - archetypal roles, not recurring):

**Partnership Structure:**
- One male, one female (configuration varies who fills which role)
- Federal/State or State/Specialist configurations
- Complementary investigative approaches creating natural friction
- Professional chemistry with light flirtation (NO romance subplot)
- Mutual respect and capability

**Archetypal Dynamics** (mix & match per book):
- Skeptic / Believer (in patterns, psychology, hunches)
- Experienced / Specialist
- Intuitive / Methodical
- Local Knowledge / Outsider Perspective
- By-the-Book / Flexible Approach

**Gender Presentation Philosophy:**
Sophisticated and confident, not anxious or apologetic. Think The Avengers 60s TV: Emma Peel (elegant capability) and Steed (gentlemanly confidence). He can be masculine (decisive, protective, direct) without being domineering. She can be feminine (intuitive, warm, detail-oriented) without being weak. No modern gender competition - just competent professionals with natural chemistry.

**Character Function:**
- Provide different perspectives on evidence
- Create natural dialogue about case
- Offer complementary skills
- Generate productive friction
- Represent reader in investigation

**Supporting Cast** (archetypal):
- Local Authority: Sheriff/Police Chief - owns jurisdiction, provides local access
- Key Local: Bartender/diner owner/motel clerk - embedded community guide
- Medical Examiner/Coroner: Forensic information delivery
- Witnesses & Community: Real people providing clues, red herrings, atmosphere
- The Victims: Their lives and vulnerabilities drive investigation
- The Killer: Local/regular presence with job enabling crimes, not theatrical

## Continuity Model

**Complete Standalone Structure:**
- No recurring characters
- No series continuity
- Each book = fresh location + fresh investigators + fresh case
- Reader can start anywhere
- Each book delivers complete investigation from arrival to resolution

## Outliner Agent Deliverables

When assigned a book concept from developed-story-seeds.md, produce THREE documents:

**1. BIBLE (2,500-3,000 words - STRICT LIMIT)**
- Story premise (100-150 words)
- Lead Investigator profile (300-400 words)
- Partner Investigator profile (300-400 words)
- Killer profile (250-350 words)
- 4-6 Supporting characters (100-150 words each)
- Setting details (400-500 words: location specifics, season, period atmosphere)
- Victim profile & pattern (200-250 words)
- Investigation framework (200-250 words: jurisdictional setup, isolation mechanisms)
- Tone & voice guidelines (150-200 words)
- Central mystery structure (200-250 words: clue placement, red herrings, resolution)

**2. MASTER OUTLINE (3,000-4,500 words - chapters UNDER 150 words each)**
- All 30 chapters summarized
- Each chapter: 100-150 words maximum
- Shows complete story arc from arrival to resolution
- Tracks: investigation progress, clue distribution, relationship development, location atmosphere
- Three-act structure clearly delineated

**3. DETAILED CHAPTER OUTLINES (7,500-9,000 words - 250-300 words per chapter)**
- Beat-by-beat scene-level guidance for each chapter
- Each chapter outline: 250-300 words
- Must include: setting & atmosphere, scene breakdown (2-4 scenes typical), character actions & interactions, dialogue direction (topics/tone, not full dialogue), emotional beats, investigation progress (evidence/clues/interviews), period details, continuity anchors (references to previous chapters), chapter purpose in story arc, ending hook

## Outline Density Standards

**Expansion Ratio:** 1 word of outline → 5-7 words of prose

For 1,700-word target chapters:
- Detailed outline needs 250-300 words of scene-level guidance
- Scriptwriter expands through: full dialogue (outline gives topics/tone), sensory description (outline sets scene), internal thoughts (outline gives emotional state), atmospheric details (outline indicates mood), pacing and rhythm (outline gives beats)

**Brief Example (Correct Density for 1,700-word chapter):**

*Chapter 5 Outline (287 words):*

Setting: Late afternoon, Cedar Lake marina, overcast. Docks mostly empty, off-season quiet. Salt air, creaking wood, distant foghorn.

Scene 1 (Investigation): Martinez and Thompson interview harbormaster Walt Drucker in cramped office overlooking docks. Drucker defensive about transient boat population - "summer people don't register, don't cause trouble." Martinez presses about May-July timeframe. Thompson notices logbook discrepancies. Drucker admits some boats slip moorage fees. Tension: Drucker wants them gone, they need cooperation. Reveals: Three unregistered boats that summer, two left mid-July, one (blue cabin cruiser) still there.

Scene 2 (Discovery): Walk to far dock examining the blue cruiser "Wanderer." Thompson checks registration - reported stolen Portland, May 15. Martinez notices rust stains on deck near cabin. Both tense - this could be dump site or killer's transportation. Thompson radios for forensics team. Discuss implications: mobility, victim transport, disposal method. Period detail: use payphone at marina office, 30-minute wait for team.

Scene 3 (Waiting/Relationship): Coffee at marina café while forensics en route. Thompson shares Pacific Northwest background - grew up coastal Washington, knows boat culture. Martinez skeptical about "boat people" - prefers solid ground, Chicago upbringing. Light banter reveals personality differences. Establishes: Thompson's local knowledge valuable, Martinez's outsider perspective brings fresh questions.

Scene 4 (Complication): Forensics van arrives but Drucker nowhere found. Search marina - office locked, truck gone. Thompson annoyed - spooked their only lead. Martinez pragmatic - boat's not going anywhere. End: Watching forensics board the Wanderer as fog rolls in. Sense of progress mixed with new questions about Drucker's flight.

*This outline gives the scriptwriter clear scene structure, character beats, dialogue direction, and atmosphere - they expand to 1,700 words through execution.*

## Success Criteria

A successful outline package enables the scriptwriter to:
- Write 1,700-word chapters without struggling for content or inventing plot
- Maintain continuity across all 30 chapters (callbacks, clue tracking, relationship development)
- Hit mystery beats appropriately (clue distribution, red herrings, fair play, revelation)
- Capture 1970s-80s period authenticity naturally (technology, culture, investigation methods)
- Deliver cosy mystery tone (atmospheric, restrained, no melodrama)
- Complete coherent 51,000-word procedural mystery novel
